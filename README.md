###features
* nice simple user interface for managing and organising
* no accounts necessary
* easy to use
* easy to configure
* easy to extend and develop
* etc.

###why tyto? what's it for?
To be honest __tyto__ arose from my own and other members of my then team desiring something easy to organise and manage your own daily workflow. This could be something simple like the current development tasks on your plate or maybe the meetings you have scheduled in the current week coming. The ability to also share this is important.

It is true that most organisations have some form of tool for this exact problem but in my experience many employees don't actually like what they are using and you still see peoples whiteboards and walls etc. covered in sticky notes.

This is why __tyto__ came about. It's simple to use, no accounts needed, you can configure it how you want, theme it and the source code isn't hard to grasp as the tech under the bonnet makes it very easy to understand therefore making it also easily extensible and customizable.

###who 's it for?
Initially, __tyto__ was intended for developers and project managers as an easy way to share current tasks and project progression.

For example; a developer may have columns set up for 'to do', 'in progress', 'awaiting merge' and 'done'. Then this can easily be shared with the project manager by using the email function. Another perspective could be that the project manager will configure a default configuration of columns etc. and then share this with the developer to load and then email back or share when necessary.

However, why have this restriction? It doesn't really make sense. As __tyto__ can be extended, configured and customized however you see fit, it can be used for many different purposes.

Examples:
* the plan for the week ahead.
* ingredient lists.
* managing your xmas shopping

To be honest, __tyto__ is in its very infant stages and is being shared to see if it gathers enough interest. It is also assumed that while it is being shared new uses will be discovered and features will be proposed as with any piece of tech.
###using tyto
the nice thing about __tyto__ is that you can use it however you want to and it's easy to do so. If you just want to simply use it and try it out for a bit then simply do that by visiting [jh3y.github.io/tyto](http://jh3y.github.io/tyto), the beauty of 'no accounts necessary'.
####using tyto in your own environment to develop against, extend, etc.
alternatively, if you want to use __tyto__ in your own environment or want to start hacking away at it and extending, configuring it etc. it's very easy!
#####prerequisites
if you're cloning the repo and setting up the codebase you are going to need __[node]()__ installed and also the __[grunt-cli]()__.
#####set up
1. simply clone the repo.

        git clone https://github.com/jh3y/tyto.git
    
2. navigate into the repo and install the dependencies.

        cd tyto
        npm install
    
3. simply run grunt to take care of preprocessing and running a webserver instance for you on port 1987(which can be configured).

        grunt

####hosting tyto
if you simply wish to host __tyto__ in your own environment you can do. I would suggest just taking a snapshot of the `gh-pages` branch and ftp'ing this onto your desired server or web space.

in most cases and ideally you will want to configure __tyto__ to your own needs and tweak it accordingly whether it be with styles and themes or you want to change the branding, html etc. To do this, the best way is to follow the instructions for developing against __tyto__ and then taking the output from this and pushing it to a desired environment or server.

####configuration
a nice feature of __tyto__ is how easily configurable it is. It handles this by having a config file that is shimmed for use with requireJS. This file is a javascript file that simply defines a block of json which is the configuration or options.
#####showIntroModalOnLoad: bool
sets whether to show the intro modal on page load.
#####introModalId: string
provides the string of the intro modal id for jQuery to use.
#####helpModalId: string
provides the string of the help modal id for jQuery to use.
#####infoModalId: string
provides the string of the info modal id for jQuery to use.
#####theme: string
defines the name of a theme to be used for the board. using `false` or leaving blank or deleting the property disables themes.
#####themePath: string
the path to a theme css file. example; 'css/themes/theme.css'
#####DOMId: string
provides the DOM id for the board component for use with jQuery.
#####DOMElementSelector: string
provides the CSS selector for the DOM element being used for the board.
#####emailSubject: string
defines a default subject of email generated by tyto.
#####emailRecipient: string
defines a default recipient of email generated by tyto.
#####actionsTab: bool
defines whether to create the menu tab or not.
#####saveFilename: string
defines the default filename for the json file that is saved when a board is saved.
#####columns: object array
this defines the default columns to be displayed on a board and the default tasks within those columns.

For example;
        
        [
            {
                title: 'A column',
                    items: [
                        {
                            content: 'im your first item.'
                        },
                        {
                            content: ' im another item.'
                        }
                    ]
            },
            {
                title: 'Another column',
                items: []
            }
        ]
####themes
another feature of tyto is the ability to add css themes on top of what is currently there as default. using the correct options(`theme` and `themePath`) within the config and creating a css theme file this can be easily accomplished.

there is a really simple theme included in the source but is switched off by default.

        .barn.themed .column .tyto-item-holder .tyto-item {
            background-color: red;
        }
        
as you can see this theme is really simple and all it does is change the default color of items to red.

note that this theme is using `themed` as a class. When you define a theme in your config, that theme name is added as a class to the DOM element being used to create the board. so with the default config you get `.barn.themed`.

###development
the beauty of __tyto__ is how easy it is to change things and really customise and extend it to be exactly what you want.
####under the hood
there are a range of technologies being used under the hood to achieve this.
* jQuery
* requireJS
* bootstrap
* Handlebars.js
* tab.js
* CSS3
* HTML5 drag and drop
* jade
* less
* coffeescript
* grunt
* modernizr

of course, the use of jade, less and coffeescript or any of the technology being used is completely optional but for me personally developing using jade, less and coffeescript in combination with grunt makes development very speedy as the project uses grunt-contrib-connect and grunt-contrib-watch also.
####templating
using jade and handlebars has made it very easy to template html for __tyto__. this makes it also easy to extend or customize in a desirable way.

using the text plugin for requireJS, __tyto__ pulls in templates and then using handlebars generates items, columns, and email drafts so changing entities is as easy as changing the template.
###roadmap and known needs
* the documentation isn't great and in some ways not clear. this does mean that there are probably ways the implementation could be made simpler.
* mobile support for touch events such as drag and swipe possibly using hammer.js
* __tyto__ is being shared in a very early age stage to get feedback primarily on how bad or maybe good it is or how it could be improved or approached differently. this is afterall my own little personal project.
* online persistence if there was demand. this does however mean accounts which isn't cool but maybe the notion of guest accounts and persistent accounts whereby multiple boards could be saved.
* better responsive design for various devices in general.
